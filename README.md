# The OpenSLO homepage source code

Everything that has been committed to the `main` branch is published automatically to [openslo.com](https://openslo.com/).

The website is built with [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/). To run it locally execute

```sh
hugo server
```

to update it just create a PR and merge it to the `main` branch.

This website contains a blog section, everybody interested in SLO, SRE, OpenSLO, etc. is welcome to write articles.
The flow is the same as for regular contributions, review will be made in a PR.

For something more complicated or when you are in doubt please create an issue first to gather feedback.
