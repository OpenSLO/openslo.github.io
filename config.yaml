    # Hero subtitle (optional)
    subtitle: OpenSLO is a service level objective (SLO) language that declaratively defines reliability and performance targets using a simple YAML specification. It is released under Apache 2.0 and we welcome contributions from the reliability engineering ecosystem. SLOs are reliability targets for services that allow organizations to make better decisions in how to create, operate, and run cloud services and applications. To learn more about SLOs, check out SLOconf.com.
